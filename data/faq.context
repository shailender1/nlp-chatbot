The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, created to help individuals operate small businesses in the U.S. One of the ways this agency helps business owners is with financing through SBA loans. Specifically, the SBA guarantees loans to qualifying businesses that do not currently meet their bank s lending criteria. If you can t get a business loan from other sources, the SBA might be a good option. Here s how it works: The SBA guarantees loans from commercial banks that provide the capital for the business loan. Chase provides SBA loans. Chase is also a SBA preferred lender, which means we can process your loan application faster. Chase has helped many businesses get the financing they need, even when other financial institutions have turned them down. SBA loans can help you get the credit you need to start or expand your business. To learn more, visit the SBA website at www.sba.gov.
A line of credit helps by providing a convenient and reliable source of funds to keep the business running when you need it most, smoothing the financial fluctuations that may occur when owning a business.
Your working capital is simply current assets minus current liabilities. It s also an indication of your liquidity at any point in your annual business cycle. By looking at your working capital, you can tell if you have enough protection to handle emergencies and/or take advantage of opportunities on short notice.
It s a flexible, easy way to get immediate cash for your business needs. You can use a revolving line of credit to cover temporary cashflow needs, finance receivables, purchase inventory, or take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Revolving lines of credit have variable rates, and the loan amounts typically range from $10,000 and up. You repay the amount borrowed through monthly payments that can usually be deducted directly from your business checking account.
This is a fixed or variable rate loan, available in amounts from $5,000 and up for a specific length of time, e.g. five years. These funds can help finance capital expenditures like new equipment, redesigning your offices, or expanding your business.
The annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the standard rate of interest charged annually on your account. It may also be referred to as the APR. Your APR is important for calculating the amount of interest charges assessed on the outstanding balance of your account. To calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR), divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365 (as there are 365 days in a year).Different rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transaction made. For example, the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
Interest charges refer to the interest which accrues on an account as a result of a revolving balance. In essence, interest charges are the fees assessed for allowing the customer to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately.Different interest rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate on the day of a transaction, if that type of transaction does not have an interest free period. For example, cash advances do not have an interest free period and the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
You pay no interest charges on purchases if you pay your  New Balance  as shown on your statement every month by the due date and time.You pay interest on purchases if you:1. Do not pay your entire balance in full every month, or2. Are in your interest-free period, but you make only a partial payment.For example:If you make $1,000 in new purchases, but make a partial payment of only $700 by the due date and time, you do not pay interest charges on the $700, but you do pay interest on the remaining $300. This occurs because you only avoid interest charges when you pay your entire balance in full by the due date and time.Balance Transfers, Checks, Cash Advances and Overdraft Advances do not have an interest-free period. This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.
A balance transfer moves some or all of the amount you owe from one credit card to another, often to take advantage of a lower annual percentage rate (APR) or other promotional offer.Balance transfer credit cards from Chasebalance transfer can help you save on interest by consolidating your higher interest rate credit card balances with other financial institutions onto one low introductory rate credit card with Chase. Fees may be associated with your balance transfer. Chase does not permit balance transfers from one Chase credit card to another Chase credit card. Select transfer a balancebalance transferif you are an existing cardmember and would like to view balance transfer offers available to you.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, created to help individuals operate small businesses in the U.S. One of the ways this agency helps business owners is with financing through SBA loans. Specifically, the SBA guarantees loans to qualifying businesses that do not currently meet their bank s lending criteria. If you can t get a business loan from other sources, the SBA might be a good option. Here s how it works: The SBA guarantees loans from commercial banks that provide the capital for the business loan. Chase provides SBA loans. Chase is also a SBA preferred lender, which means we can process your loan application faster. Chase has helped many businesses get the financing they need, even when other financial institutions have turned them down. SBA loans can help you get the credit you need to start or expand your business. To learn more, visit the SBA website at www.sba.gov.
A line of credit helps by providing a convenient and reliable source of funds to keep the business running when you need it most, smoothing the financial fluctuations that may occur when owning a business.
Your working capital is simply current assets minus current liabilities. It s also an indication of your liquidity at any point in your annual business cycle. By looking at your working capital, you can tell if you have enough protection to handle emergencies and/or take advantage of opportunities on short notice.
It s a flexible, easy way to get immediate cash for your business needs. You can use a revolving line of credit to cover temporary cashflow needs, finance receivables, purchase inventory, or take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Revolving lines of credit have variable rates, and the loan amounts typically range from $10,000 and up. You repay the amount borrowed through monthly payments that can usually be deducted directly from your business checking account.
This is a fixed or variable rate loan, available in amounts from $5,000 and up for a specific length of time, e.g. five years. These funds can help finance capital expenditures like new equipment, redesigning your offices, or expanding your business.
The annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the standard rate of interest charged annually on your account. It may also be referred to as the APR. Your APR is important for calculating the amount of interest charges assessed on the outstanding balance of your account. To calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR), divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365 (as there are 365 days in a year).Different rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transaction made. For example, the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
Interest charges refer to the interest which accrues on an account as a result of a revolving balance. In essence, interest charges are the fees assessed for allowing the customer to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately.Different interest rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate on the day of a transaction, if that type of transaction does not have an interest free period. For example, cash advances do not have an interest free period and the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
You pay no interest charges on purchases if you pay your  New Balance  as shown on your statement every month by the due date and time.You pay interest on purchases if you:1. Do not pay your entire balance in full every month, or2. Are in your interest-free period, but you make only a partial payment.For example:If you make $1,000 in new purchases, but make a partial payment of only $700 by the due date and time, you do not pay interest charges on the $700, but you do pay interest on the remaining $300. This occurs because you only avoid interest charges when you pay your entire balance in full by the due date and time.Balance Transfers, Checks, Cash Advances and Overdraft Advances do not have an interest-free period. This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.
A balance transfer moves some or all of the amount you owe from one credit card to another, often to take advantage of a lower annual percentage rate (APR) or other promotional offer.Balance transfer credit cards from Chasebalance transfer can help you save on interest by consolidating your higher interest rate credit card balances with other financial institutions onto one low introductory rate credit card with Chase. Fees may be associated with your balance transfer. Chase does not permit balance transfers from one Chase credit card to another Chase credit card.

You may want to consider refinancing if you are interested in paying off high-interest-rate debt, shortening the length of your repayment term for your mortgage or lowering your monthly mortgage payment.
Generally speaking, one or more of the following conditions needs to be present before you should consider refinancing your mortgage:Mortgage interest rates are fallingYour home has significantly appreciated in market valueYou've been making payments on your original 30-year mortgage for less than ten years
Yes. Chase offers a variety of options that allow you to tap into your home's equity and take cash out. Consult your Mortgage Banker for the best cash-out refinancing option for you.
Cash-out refinancing can help homeowners who want to consolidate high-interest debt. Because your mortgage interest rate is likely to be lower than rates on credit cards or other types of bank loans, consolidating debt may reduce your overall monthly debt payments.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, created to help individuals operate small businesses in the U.S. One of the ways this agency helps business owners is with financing through SBA loans. Specifically, the SBA guarantees loans to qualifying businesses that do not currently meet their bank s lending criteria. If you can t get a business loan from other sources, the SBA might be a good option. Here s how it works: The SBA guarantees loans from commercial banks that provide the capital for the business loan. Chase provides SBA loans. Chase is also a SBA preferred lender, which means we can process your loan application faster. Chase has helped many businesses get the financing they need, even when other financial institutions have turned them down.

A line of credit helps by providing a convenient and reliable source of funds to keep the business running when you need it most, smoothing the financial fluctuations that may occur when owning a business.
Your working capital is simply current assets minus current liabilities. It s also an indication of your liquidity at any point in your annual business cycle. By looking at your working capital, you can tell if you have enough protection to handle emergencies and/or take advantage of opportunities on short notice.
It s a flexible, easy way to get immediate cash for your business needs. You can use a revolving line of credit to cover temporary cashflow needs, finance receivables, purchase inventory, or take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Revolving lines of credit have variable rates, and the loan amounts typically range from $10,000 and up. You repay the amount borrowed through monthly payments that can usually be deducted directly from your business checking account.
This is a fixed or variable rate loan, available in amounts from $5,000 and up for a specific length of time, e.g. five years. These funds can help finance capital expenditures like new equipment, redesigning your offices, or expanding your business.
The annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the standard rate of interest charged annually on your account. It may also be referred to as the APR. Your APR is important for calculating the amount of interest charges assessed on the outstanding balance of your account. To calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR), divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365 (as there are 365 days in a year).Different rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transaction made. For example, the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
Interest charges refer to the interest which accrues on an account as a result of a revolving balance. In essence, interest charges are the fees assessed for allowing the customer to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately.Different interest rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate on the day of a transaction, if that type of transaction does not have an interest free period. For example, cash advances do not have an interest free period and the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
You pay no interest charges on purchases if you pay your  New Balance  as shown on your statement every month by the due date and time.You pay interest on purchases if you:1. Do not pay your entire balance in full every month, or2. Are in your interest-free period, but you make only a partial payment.For example:If you make $1,000 in new purchases, but make a partial payment of only $700 by the due date and time, you do not pay interest charges on the $700, but you do pay interest on the remaining $300. This occurs because you only avoid interest charges when you pay your entire balance in full by the due date and time.Balance Transfers, Checks, Cash Advances and Overdraft Advances do not have an interest-free period. This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.
A balance transfer moves some or all of the amount you owe from one credit card to another, often to take advantage of a lower annual percentage rate (APR) or other promotional offer.Balance transfer credit cards from Chasebalance transfer can help you save on interest by consolidating your higher interest rate credit card balances with other financial institutions onto one low introductory rate credit card with Chase.

You may want to consider refinancing if you are interested in paying off high-interest-rate debt, shortening the length of your repayment term for your mortgage or lowering your monthly mortgage payment.
Generally speaking, one or more of the following conditions needs to be present before you should consider refinancing your mortgage:Mortgage interest rates are fallingYour home has significantly appreciated in market valueYou've been making payments on your original 30-year mortgage for less than ten years
Yes. Chase offers a variety of options that allow you to tap into your home's equity and take cash out. Consult your Mortgage Banker for the best cash-out refinancing option for you.
Cash-out refinancing can help homeowners who want to consolidate high-interest debt. Because your mortgage interest rate is likely to be lower than rates on credit cards or other types of bank loans, consolidating debt may reduce your overall monthly debt payments.

You may want to consider refinancing if you are interested in paying off high-interest-rate debt, shortening the length of your repayment term for your mortgage or lowering your monthly mortgage payment.
Generally speaking, one or more of the following conditions needs to be present before you should consider refinancing your mortgage:Mortgage interest rates are fallingYour home has significantly appreciated in market valueYou've been making payments on your original 30-year mortgage for less than ten years
Yes. Chase offers a variety of options that allow you to tap into your home's equity and take cash out. Consult your Mortgage Banker for the best cash-out refinancing option for you.
Cash-out refinancing can help homeowners who want to consolidate high-interest debt. Because your mortgage interest rate is likely to be lower than rates on credit cards or other types of bank loans, consolidating debt may reduce your overall monthly debt payments.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, created to help individuals operate small businesses in the U.S. One of the ways this agency helps business owners is with financing through SBA loans. Specifically, the SBA guarantees loans to qualifying businesses that do not currently meet their bank s lending criteria. If you can t get a business loan from other sources, the SBA might be a good option. Here s how it works: The SBA guarantees loans from commercial banks that provide the capital for the business loan. Chase provides SBA loans. Chase is also a SBA preferred lender, which means we can process your loan application faster. Chase has helped many businesses get the financing they need, even when other financial institutions have turned them down. SBA loans can help you get the credit you need to start or expand your business. To learn more, visit the SBA website at www.sba.gov.
A line of credit helps by providing a convenient and reliable source of funds to keep the business running when you need it most, smoothing the financial fluctuations that may occur when owning a business.
Your working capital is simply current assets minus current liabilities. It s also an indication of your liquidity at any point in your annual business cycle. By looking at your working capital, you can tell if you have enough protection to handle emergencies and/or take advantage of opportunities on short notice.
It s a flexible, easy way to get immediate cash for your business needs. You can use a revolving line of credit to cover temporary cashflow needs, finance receivables, purchase inventory, or take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Revolving lines of credit have variable rates, and the loan amounts typically range from $10,000 and up. You repay the amount borrowed through monthly payments that can usually be deducted directly from your business checking account.
This is a fixed or variable rate loan, available in amounts from $5,000 and up for a specific length of time, e.g. five years. These funds can help finance capital expenditures like new equipment, redesigning your offices, or expanding your business.
The annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the standard rate of interest charged annually on your account. It may also be referred to as the APR. Your APR is important for calculating the amount of interest charges assessed on the outstanding balance of your account. To calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR), divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365 (as there are 365 days in a year).Different rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transaction made. For example, the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
Interest charges refer to the interest which accrues on an account as a result of a revolving balance. In essence, interest charges are the fees assessed for allowing the customer to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately.Different interest rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate on the day of a transaction, if that type of transaction does not have an interest free period. For example, cash advances do not have an interest free period and the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
You pay no interest charges on purchases if you pay your  New Balance  as shown on your statement every month by the due date and time.You pay interest on purchases if you:1. Do not pay your entire balance in full every month, or2. Are in your interest-free period, but you make only a partial payment.For example:If you make $1,000 in new purchases, but make a partial payment of only $700 by the due date and time, you do not pay interest charges on the $700, but you do pay interest on the remaining $300. This occurs because you only avoid interest charges when you pay your entire balance in full by the due date and time.Balance Transfers, Checks, Cash Advances and Overdraft Advances do not have an interest-free period. This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.
A balance transfer moves some or all of the amount you owe from one credit card to another, often to take advantage of a lower annual percentage rate (APR) or other promotional offer.Balance transfer credit cards from Chasebalance transfer can help you save on interest by consolidating your higher interest rate credit card balances with other financial institutions onto one low introductory rate credit card with Chase. Fees may be associated with your balance transfer. Chase does not permit balance transfers from one Chase credit card to another Chase credit card.

Yes. Chase offers a variety of options that allow you to tap into your home's equity and take cash out. Consult your Mortgage Banker for the best cash-out refinancing option for you.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, created to help individuals operate small businesses in the U.S. One of the ways this agency helps business owners is with financing through SBA loans. Specifically, the SBA guarantees loans to qualifying businesses that do not currently meet their bank s lending criteria. If you can t get a business loan from other sources, the SBA might be a good option. Here s how it works: The SBA guarantees loans from commercial banks that provide the capital for the business loan. Chase provides SBA loans. Chase is also a SBA preferred lender, which means we can process your loan application faster. Chase has helped many businesses get the financing they need, even when other financial institutions have turned them down. SBA loans can help you get the credit you need to start or expand your business. To learn more, visit the SBA website at www.sba.gov.
A line of credit helps by providing a convenient and reliable source of funds to keep the business running when you need it most, smoothing the financial fluctuations that may occur when owning a business.
Your working capital is simply current assets minus current liabilities. It s also an indication of your liquidity at any point in your annual business cycle. By looking at your working capital, you can tell if you have enough protection to handle emergencies and/or take advantage of opportunities on short notice.
It s a flexible, easy way to get immediate cash for your business needs. You can use a revolving line of credit to cover temporary cashflow needs, finance receivables, purchase inventory, or take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Revolving lines of credit have variable rates, and the loan amounts typically range from $10,000 and up. You repay the amount borrowed through monthly payments that can usually be deducted directly from your business checking account.
This is a fixed or variable rate loan, available in amounts from $5,000 and up for a specific length of time, e.g. five years. These funds can help finance capital expenditures like new equipment, redesigning your offices, or expanding your business.
The annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the standard rate of interest charged annually on your account. It may also be referred to as the APR. Your APR is important for calculating the amount of interest charges assessed on the outstanding balance of your account. To calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR), divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365 (as there are 365 days in a year).Different rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transaction made. For example, the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
Interest charges refer to the interest which accrues on an account as a result of a revolving balance. In essence, interest charges are the fees assessed for allowing the customer to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately.Different interest rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate on the day of a transaction, if that type of transaction does not have an interest free period. For example, cash advances do not have an interest free period and the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
You pay no interest charges on purchases if you pay your  New Balance  as shown on your statement every month by the due date and time.You pay interest on purchases if you:1. Do not pay your entire balance in full every month, or2. Are in your interest-free period, but you make only a partial payment.For example:If you make $1,000 in new purchases, but make a partial payment of only $700 by the due date and time, you do not pay interest charges on the $700, but you do pay interest on the remaining $300. This occurs because you only avoid interest charges when you pay your entire balance in full by the due date and time.Balance Transfers, Checks, Cash Advances and Overdraft Advances do not have an interest-free period. This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.
A balance transfer moves some or all of the amount you owe from one credit card to another, often to take advantage of a lower annual percentage rate (APR) or other promotional offer.Balance transfer credit cards from Chasebalance transfer can help you save on interest by consolidating your higher interest rate credit card balances with other financial institutions onto one low introductory rate credit card with Chase. Fees may be associated with your balance transfer. Chase does not permit balance transfers from one Chase credit card to another Chase credit card.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, created to help individuals operate small businesses in the U.S. One of the ways this agency helps business owners is with financing through SBA loans. Specifically, the SBA guarantees loans to qualifying businesses that do not currently meet their bank s lending criteria. If you can t get a business loan from other sources, the SBA might be a good option. Here s how it works: The SBA guarantees loans from commercial banks that provide the capital for the business loan. Chase provides SBA loans. Chase is also a SBA preferred lender, which means we can process your loan application faster. Chase has helped many businesses get the financing they need, even when other financial institutions have turned them down.

A line of credit helps by providing a convenient and reliable source of funds to keep the business running when you need it most, smoothing the financial fluctuations that may occur when owning a business.
Your working capital is simply current assets minus current liabilities. It s also an indication of your liquidity at any point in your annual business cycle. By looking at your working capital, you can tell if you have enough protection to handle emergencies and/or take advantage of opportunities on short notice.
It s a flexible, easy way to get immediate cash for your business needs. You can use a revolving line of credit to cover temporary cashflow needs, finance receivables, purchase inventory, or take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Revolving lines of credit have variable rates, and the loan amounts typically range from $10,000 and up. You repay the amount borrowed through monthly payments that can usually be deducted directly from your business checking account.
This is a fixed or variable rate loan, available in amounts from $5,000 and up for a specific length of time, e.g. five years. These funds can help finance capital expenditures like new equipment, redesigning your offices, or expanding your business.
The annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the standard rate of interest charged annually on your account. It may also be referred to as the APR. Your APR is important for calculating the amount of interest charges assessed on the outstanding balance of your account. To calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR), divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365 (as there are 365 days in a year).Different rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transaction made. For example, the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
Interest charges refer to the interest which accrues on an account as a result of a revolving balance. In essence, interest charges are the fees assessed for allowing the customer to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately.Different interest rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate on the day of a transaction, if that type of transaction does not have an interest free period. For example, cash advances do not have an interest free period and the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
You pay no interest charges on purchases if you pay your  New Balance  as shown on your statement every month by the due date and time.You pay interest on purchases if you:1. Do not pay your entire balance in full every month, or2. Are in your interest-free period, but you make only a partial payment.For example:If you make $1,000 in new purchases, but make a partial payment of only $700 by the due date and time, you do not pay interest charges on the $700, but you do pay interest on the remaining $300. This occurs because you only avoid interest charges when you pay your entire balance in full by the due date and time.Balance Transfers, Checks, Cash Advances and Overdraft Advances do not have an interest-free period. This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.
A balance transfer moves some or all of the amount you owe from one credit card to another, often to take advantage of a lower annual percentage rate (APR) or other promotional offer.Balance transfer credit cards from Chasebalance transfer can help you save on interest by consolidating your higher interest rate credit card balances with other financial institutions onto one low introductory rate credit card with Chase. Fees may be associated with your balance transfer. Chase does not permit balance transfers from one Chase credit card to another Chase credit card.

You may want to consider refinancing if you are interested in paying off high-interest-rate debt, shortening the length of your repayment term for your mortgage or lowering your monthly mortgage payment.

Yes. Chase offers a variety of options that allow you to tap into your home's equity and take cash out. Consult your Mortgage Banker for the best cash-out refinancing option for you.
Cash-out refinancing can help homeowners who want to consolidate high-interest debt. Because your mortgage interest rate is likely to be lower than rates on credit cards or other types of bank loans, consolidating debt may reduce your overall monthly debt payments.

This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.

Yes. Chase offers a variety of options that allow you to tap into your home's equity and take cash out. Consult your Mortgage Banker for the best cash-out refinancing option for you.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, created to help individuals operate small businesses in the U.S. One of the ways this agency helps business owners is with financing through SBA loans. Specifically, the SBA guarantees loans to qualifying businesses that do not currently meet their bank s lending criteria. If you can t get a business loan from other sources, the SBA might be a good option. Here s how it works: The SBA guarantees loans from commercial banks that provide the capital for the business loan. Chase provides SBA loans. Chase is also a SBA preferred lender, which means we can process your loan application faster. Chase has helped many businesses get the financing they need, even when other financial institutions have turned them down. SBA loans can help you get the credit you need to start or expand your business. To learn more, visit the SBA website at www.sba.gov.
A line of credit helps by providing a convenient and reliable source of funds to keep the business running when you need it most, smoothing the financial fluctuations that may occur when owning a business.
Your working capital is simply current assets minus current liabilities. It s also an indication of your liquidity at any point in your annual business cycle. By looking at your working capital, you can tell if you have enough protection to handle emergencies and/or take advantage of opportunities on short notice.
It s a flexible, easy way to get immediate cash for your business needs. You can use a revolving line of credit to cover temporary cashflow needs, finance receivables, purchase inventory, or take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Revolving lines of credit have variable rates, and the loan amounts typically range from $10,000 and up. You repay the amount borrowed through monthly payments that can usually be deducted directly from your business checking account.
This is a fixed or variable rate loan, available in amounts from $5,000 and up for a specific length of time, e.g. five years. These funds can help finance capital expenditures like new equipment, redesigning your offices, or expanding your business.
The annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the standard rate of interest charged annually on your account. It may also be referred to as the APR. Your APR is important for calculating the amount of interest charges assessed on the outstanding balance of your account. To calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR), divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365 (as there are 365 days in a year).Different rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transaction made. For example, the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
Interest charges refer to the interest which accrues on an account as a result of a revolving balance. In essence, interest charges are the fees assessed for allowing the customer to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately.Different interest rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate on the day of a transaction, if that type of transaction does not have an interest free period. For example, cash advances do not have an interest free period and the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
You pay no interest charges on purchases if you pay your  New Balance  as shown on your statement every month by the due date and time.You pay interest on purchases if you:1. Do not pay your entire balance in full every month, or2. Are in your interest-free period, but you make only a partial payment.For example:If you make $1,000 in new purchases, but make a partial payment of only $700 by the due date and time, you do not pay interest charges on the $700, but you do pay interest on the remaining $300. This occurs because you only avoid interest charges when you pay your entire balance in full by the due date and time.Balance Transfers, Checks, Cash Advances and Overdraft Advances do not have an interest-free period. This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.

You may want to consider refinancing if you are interested in paying off high-interest-rate debt, shortening the length of your repayment term for your mortgage or lowering your monthly mortgage payment.
Generally speaking, one or more of the following conditions needs to be present before you should consider refinancing your mortgage:Mortgage interest rates are fallingYour home has significantly appreciated in market valueYou've been making payments on your original 30-year mortgage for less than ten years
Yes. Chase offers a variety of options that allow you to tap into your home's equity and take cash out. Consult your Mortgage Banker for the best cash-out refinancing option for you.
Cash-out refinancing can help homeowners who want to consolidate high-interest debt. Because your mortgage interest rate is likely to be lower than rates on credit cards or other types of bank loans, consolidating debt may reduce your overall monthly debt payments.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, created to help individuals operate small businesses in the U.S. One of the ways this agency helps business owners is with financing through SBA loans. Specifically, the SBA guarantees loans to qualifying businesses that do not currently meet their bank s lending criteria. If you can t get a business loan from other sources, the SBA might be a good option. Here s how it works: The SBA guarantees loans from commercial banks that provide the capital for the business loan. Chase provides SBA loans. Chase is also a SBA preferred lender, which means we can process your loan application faster. Chase has helped many businesses get the financing they need, even when other financial institutions have turned them down. SBA loans can help you get the credit you need to start or expand your business. To learn more, visit the SBA website at www.sba.gov.
A line of credit helps by providing a convenient and reliable source of funds to keep the business running when you need it most, smoothing the financial fluctuations that may occur when owning a business.
Your working capital is simply current assets minus current liabilities. It s also an indication of your liquidity at any point in your annual business cycle. By looking at your working capital, you can tell if you have enough protection to handle emergencies and/or take advantage of opportunities on short notice.
It s a flexible, easy way to get immediate cash for your business needs. You can use a revolving line of credit to cover temporary cashflow needs, finance receivables, purchase inventory, or take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Revolving lines of credit have variable rates, and the loan amounts typically range from $10,000 and up. You repay the amount borrowed through monthly payments that can usually be deducted directly from your business checking account.
This is a fixed or variable rate loan, available in amounts from $5,000 and up for a specific length of time, e.g. five years. These funds can help finance capital expenditures like new equipment, redesigning your offices, or expanding your business.
The annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the standard rate of interest charged annually on your account. It may also be referred to as the APR. Your APR is important for calculating the amount of interest charges assessed on the outstanding balance of your account. To calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR), divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365 (as there are 365 days in a year).Different rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transaction made. For example, the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
Interest charges refer to the interest which accrues on an account as a result of a revolving balance. In essence, interest charges are the fees assessed for allowing the customer to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately.Different interest rates may be assessed to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate on the day of a transaction, if that type of transaction does not have an interest free period. For example, cash advances do not have an interest free period and the rate assessed on a cash advance is often higher than the rate assessed for purchase transactions. Check your cardmember agreement for details specific to your account.
You pay no interest charges on purchases if you pay your  New Balance  as shown on your statement every month by the due date and time.You pay interest on purchases if you:1. Do not pay your entire balance in full every month, or2. Are in your interest-free period, but you make only a partial payment.For example:If you make $1,000 in new purchases, but make a partial payment of only $700 by the due date and time, you do not pay interest charges on the $700, but you do pay interest on the remaining $300. This occurs because you only avoid interest charges when you pay your entire balance in full by the due date and time.Balance Transfers, Checks, Cash Advances and Overdraft Advances do not have an interest-free period. This means that you pay interest from the date of these transactions until they are fully paid.If you have any balance on your account (including 0% APR balance transfers) that you do not pay off in full, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases and you will be charged interest on new purchases.For example:You transfer a balance or write a check for $600 at a 0% APR for 12 months. Then you make $300 in new purchases which brings your total balance to $900. In this example:You would be charged interest on your new purchases ($300) if you do not pay the entire balance of $900 by the due date and time.You would NOT be charged interest on your $600 0% APR Balance Transfer for the 12 month offer period.
A balance transfer moves some or all of the amount you owe from one credit card to another, often to take advantage of a lower annual percentage rate (APR) or other promotional offer.Balance transfer credit cards from Chasebalance transfer can help you save on interest by consolidating your higher interest rate credit card balances with other financial institutions onto one low introductory rate credit card with Chase. Fees may be associated with your balance transfer. Chase does not permit balance transfers from one Chase credit card to another Chase credit card.
